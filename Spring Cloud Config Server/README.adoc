= Config Server =

== Introducción ==
This project born with the idea of connect a spring cloud config server with two different repositories
Vault and Git

== Vault Configuration

The first step is running a vault, for this we are going to use docker.

=== First Step

```
docker run -d -p 8200:8200 --name vault -e 'VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=myroot' -e 'VAULT_DEV_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8200' vault
```

=== Second Step
Add variables into vault

```
docker exec -i -t vault sh
export VAULT_ADDR='http://localhost:8200'
export VAULT_TOKEN="myroot"
```

=== Thrid Step
Add values into vault, from inside:

```
vault kv put secret/configclient client.property=hola
```

== Git configuration
Add a file into git, if you don't want to make a new file or repository you can use this:

=== Run the server
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
